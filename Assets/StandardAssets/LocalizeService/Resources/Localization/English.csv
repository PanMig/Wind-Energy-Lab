//Surprize scene
text(s1),"Five years have passed since the establishment of your wind farm.The power consumption of the village is lower than initially planned due to most of its residents left. What do you consider to be the most appropriate option from the list below?"
title(s1), Future Scenario 1
opt1(s1),Turn off completely the excess of wind turbines
opt2(s1),Keep the wind farm and sell the excess of power generated by connecting the wind farm with the main electricity grid
opt3(s1),Do nothing keep everything as it is

text(s2),"In this scenario things had gone opposite. The power consumption of the village has been increased because of a large hotel resort establishement in the area. How will you react?"
title(s2), Future Scenario 2
opt1(s2),Try to install more wind turbines in the same area
opt2(s2),Keep the wind farm as is and install a new wind farm(or even solar panels) in a new area
opt3(s2),Do nothing keep everything as it is
