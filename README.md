# Wind Enegy Lab

Wind energy lab is a serious game where the player gets to control a wind farm to provide electrical energy to a small town. Through the process of the game, you will have to select the place where your wind park will be installed, select between a number of different wind turbines types to use, as well as operate the wind farm to produce the correct amount of power

This project is made using Unity 3d as well as Blender 3d and it belongs to the Envisage Project (http://www.envisage-h2020.eu/).

# Game overview

You and your team have undertaken to study the construction of a wind farm.
The wind park should meet the energy needs of a village with the following characteristics.

Population: 4000 || Households: 1800 || Power requested: 6MW

Through the process of the game, you will have to select the place where your wind park will be installed, select between a number of different wind turbines types to use, as well as operate the wind farm to produce the correct amount of power requested.
However, the amount of electricity generated depends on the strength of the wind - if there is no wind, there is no electricity.
You will see that maintaining the correct amount of power - not too little, or not too much - while both wind and the power requirements of the town are constantly fluctuating can prove a challenge. Sometimes there will be insufficient power generated even with all available turbines in operation. At other times the power generated will be too great. The aim is to maximise the amount of time that only the correct amount of electricity is generated.
